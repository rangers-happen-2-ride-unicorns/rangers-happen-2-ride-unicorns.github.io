<center> <h3>Guidelines :</h3></center>

    These are the guidelines for participating with the CTF team.

We are a learning-oriented team that is open to everyone.

<ol>

    <li>  Anyone can join us, but you they must actively participate to stay a member. Don’t get discouraged if you don’t feel you are contributing much. Being part of the team and learning about an area IS contributing. You will get there if you stick with it. Don’t give up.</li>

<li>We only ask that you try your best. Show an interest in learning and challenging yourself.</li>

<li>Being the top team on the scoreboard has no real value. Expanding your knowlege and growing your skillset is the only metric that really matters.</li>

    <li>Be respectful of other team members.</li>

<li>Don’t be a dick. Everyone is here to learn, and everyone has deficiencies and That’s okay! That’s why we’re all here!
During a CTF, you should idle in the team channel.</li>
    </ol>


This is where most of the teamwork, discussion, and collaboration starts.

<ol>
<li>The channel may be locked down before the CTF so be sure to be in the channel before the CTF. If you didn’t make it or get disconnected, let someone know and an OP will invite you back.</li>

<li>In addition, we share resources we find for learning on the channel. Feel free to do that. If you want to pick a category or two to focus on, feel free to announce it and ask for suggested resources for it. You are likely to get a lot of great suggestions. You might even find a study partner for that category.
Announce which task you are going to work on.</li>

<li>The only way people can work with you is if they know what you’re working on! If you want/need help, feel free to discuss with others on the team, but keep the conversation general. If you want to get into the nitty-gritty of a challenge, send a private message to someone you’re working with.</li>

<li>If you are stuck, see if someone on our team can look at a problem with you or give you some feedback on what you are doing. However, keep in mind that everyone is working on something so you might not get any feedback. Move on to another problem until someone is available to assist you.
Do not share or ask for flags until after the CTF.</li>

<li>If you share (or ask for) flags during the CTF you will probably get booted from the channel and from the team.
If you solve a problem, let everyone know you solved it.</li>

<li>This is so that others in the team can stop working on it if they want to do so. Feel free to discuss exactly how you solved the challenge AFTER the CTF is over.</li>

<li>Just because we have solved the problem doesn’t mean you have to stop working on it. If you are learning and it has captured your interest, keep working on it. It isn’t about getting more flags, it is all about learning.
Do not ask other teams for hints.</li>

<li>If you really need a hint, ask an admin. They can decide if they will give you one or not. Don’t count on it, though, since they tend to post hints for everyone at the same time.
No cheating of any kind.

    No attacking the CTF server or opposing teams.
    No flag trading</li>

<li>It isn’t about winning, it is about learning. Cheating is counterproductive to learning.
Do not whine on any CTF channel other than our own about the CTF or problems. </li>

<li>Be prepared for people to tell you to STFU if you do it too much. Some venting is okay, but move on to another challenge if you are really frustrated. </li>

Participation is expected and required when possible.

<li>If you join the team, you are required to be involved. Otherwise why be on a team? If you do not play in at least one CTF per month and visit slack bi-weekly, you will be dropped from the slack channel and the ‘active’ team. You can still hang in IRC, of course. Normally active team members and those with a good excuse can be exempted from this requirement.</li>

</ol>

    <b><center>NOTE: These guidelines may change, and enforcement is at the discretion of the team leadership.</center></b>
